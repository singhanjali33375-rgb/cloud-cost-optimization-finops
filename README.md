# cloud-cost-optimization-finops
An advanced cloud cost optimization and cloud economics project implementing FinOps principles, cost visibility, resource right-sizing, budgeting, alerts, and optimization strategies across cloud infrastructure using real-world tools and best practices.
# Cloud Cost Optimization & Cloud Economics (FinOps Project)

This project demonstrates a production-grade cloud cost optimization
and cloud economics implementation based on FinOps principles.
It focuses on reducing cloud spend, improving cost visibility,
and aligning engineering decisions with business value.

## Why This Project Is Very Advanced
- Focuses on cloud economics, not just infrastructure
- Implements FinOps best practices
- Real-world cost optimization strategies
- Automation-driven savings
- Strong business + technical alignment

## Key FinOps Pillars Covered
- Visibility & Allocation
- Optimization & Efficiency
- Governance & Control

## Architecture Overview
Cloud Resources → Cost Data Collection  
→ Analysis & Dashboards  
→ Optimization Engine  
→ Budgets & Alerts  
→ Continuous Savings

## Cloud & Tools Used
- AWS / Azure / GCP
- Terraform (IaC)
- AWS Cost Explorer / Azure Cost Management
- CloudWatch / Monitoring
- Python (Cost Analysis)
- Grafana (Visualization)
- GitHub Actions

## Optimization Techniques Implemented
- Right-sizing compute resources
- Identifying idle resources
- Storage lifecycle policies
- Reserved Instances & Savings Plans analysis
- Auto-scaling cost impact analysis
- Budget alerts & governance

## Folder Structure
